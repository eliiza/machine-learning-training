A bitmap refers to exactly what the name says, a map or raster of bits, so a grid of values that are either 0 or 1. The individual colour images that make up our example have different intensities, though, their pixels are not just switched on or off. The examples are maps of values between 0 and 255, in other words, each grid point has not just a bit, but a byte to represent values. In a funny twist of fortune, this arrangement is not called a bytemap, but a pixelmap, or pixmap for short.  \n",
