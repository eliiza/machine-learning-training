# Eliiza Machine Learning Training

## Current training modules

1.  [Getting started with Machine Learning](notebooks/getting_started_with_ml/README.md)
    - Half a day or a full day workshop
2.  [Getting started with TensorFlow](notebooks/getting_started_with_tf/README.md)
    - Half a day or a full day workshop

## Environment Setup

Python 3.x is used for this workshop.

There are two options for working with notebooks in this repository:

- Google Colab (online)
- Local Python environment (offline)

Note that irrespective of the options above, the dependencies can be installed like this:

```
$> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or individually:

```
$> python -m pip install tensorflow
```

### Google Colab

Google [Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) is online Jupyter notebook-like environment that is pre-configured with Python and many popular data science and ML libraries. It also comes with GPU support.

Here are a few helpful resources: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=-Rh3-Vt9Nev9.

### Local Python environment

While its fine to [set up](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) Python and the project's dependencies individually, the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) environment is better suited to getting started quickly & packages many common dependencies and tools.
