    "In this section we'll be diving into TensorFlow and Artificial Neural Networks, in the first segment we'll be covering (at a high level) what Neural Networks are, how they're trained, and how TensorFlow can help. After that we will look more in more detail at Convolutional Neural Networks and Residual Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the session we'll be working with a dataset called CIFAR10. As you will no doubt be aware, before you start trying to apply any AI/ML the first step is to obtain and understand the dataset. How do I get it? What is the format? Does it need any preprocessing to clean or normalise it? This notebook will run through that and show you where we will (hopefully) end up.\n",
